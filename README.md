# Student ID Card Project

This is a simple HTML-based student ID card project created as an academic project. It reflects my enthusiasm while showcasing my academic journey in a visual format.

The project includes basic HTML and CSS elements to generate a mock ID card containing course details, a photo, and a print option.

PS: This project was created solely for academic and application purposes. It is not an official university-issued document.
